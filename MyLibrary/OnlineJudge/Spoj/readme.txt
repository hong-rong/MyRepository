74. Divisor Summation
Given a natural number n (1 <= n <= 500000), please output the summation of all its proper divisors.

Definition: A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.

e.g. number 20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22.



Input

An integer stating the number of test cases (equal to about 200000), and that many lines follow, each containing one integer between 1 and 500000 inclusive.

Output

One integer each line: the divisor summation of the integer given respectively.

Example

Sample Input:
3
2
10
20

Sample Output:
1
8
22

511. Easy Sorting
Given is a list of words and a lexicographical ordering according to the ascii alphabet. Your task is to sort the words in increasing order.

Input

The first line contains the numbers of testcases k (k< 100). Every testcase c onsists of n+1 (1< n< 50000) lines. 
Each line contains of a string of 10 character s. The first line of each testcase contains n.

Output

Output the sorted list of words.

Example

Input:
2
2
helloworld
worldhello
2
aaaaaaaaaa
Aaaaaaaaaa
Output:
helloworld
worldhello
Aaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaa
